# Machine Learning Assignment Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Assignment Repository! This repository contains all the code, data, and resources related to our exciting machine learning assignment. Here, we will explore and implement cutting-edge machine learning techniques to solve challenging problems and gain valuable insights from data.

## Assignment Overview

In this assignment, we will delve into various aspects of machine learning, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model selection and evaluation. Our main goal is to apply machine learning algorithms to real-world datasets and develop predictive models that can make accurate and meaningful predictions.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following main folders:

- **data**: This folder contains the datasets we will be working with. Make sure to include detailed descriptions of each dataset and their sources.

- **notebooks**: Here, you will find Jupyter notebooks documenting our step-by-step analysis, code implementations, and visualizations. These notebooks provide insights into our thought process and how we approached different stages of the assignment.

- **scripts**: This folder houses any reusable scripts or helper functions that we create for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- **models**: After training, the best-performing models will be saved in this directory. Provide clear documentation about the trained models, their architecture, and their performance metrics.

- **results**: We will store the results of our experiments here, including visualizations, graphs, and any other output that helps illustrate our findings.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. Set up your environment by installing the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

3. Explore the `notebooks` directory to follow our analysis and code implementation.

4. Feel free to experiment with the code, try different algorithms, and improve upon our results. Don't forget to document your changes and observations in separate notebook files.

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from everyone! If you find a bug, have suggestions for improvements, or want to add new features, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your contribution.

2. Make your changes and improvements, following the coding and documentation standards.

3. Open a pull request, describing your changes and the problem or feature they address.
