        "1. ***Artificial Intelligence (AI):***\n",
        "    Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems. AI enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, reasoning, and decision-making. AI can be categorized into narrow or weak AI, which is designed for specific tasks, and general or strong AI, which would have human-level cognitive abilities.\n",

These applications can understand natural language, interpret user commands, and provide relevant responses or perform tasks like setting reminders, sending messages, or providing weather updates.\n",

It focuses on the development of techniques that enable computers to automatically analyze and interpret data and make predictions or decisions based on patterns and examples.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Example: Email spam filters are a common application of machine learning. Instead of manually coding rules to identify spam, a machine learning model can be trained on a dataset of emails labeled as spam or not spam. The model learns patterns from the data and can then accurately classify new emails as spam or not based on its learned knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. ***Deep Learning:***\n",
        "\n",
        "    Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that specifically deals with neural networks containing multiple layers (deep neural networks). It aims to mimic the human brain's structure and function by using interconnected layers of artificial neurons to process and learn from data. Deep learning has shown remarkable success in tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more.\n",

        "    Example: Image recognition is an area where deep learning excels. Consider a deep learning model for image classification. It could be trained on a large dataset of images labeled with different objects. The model learns to recognize features and patterns in images by adjusting the weights of its interconnected neurons. Once trained, it can accurately identify objects in new images, such as labeling a photo of a cat as a \"cat.\"\n",
